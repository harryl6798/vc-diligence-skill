# VC Diligence Skill: The Ultimate Lead Partner Framework (V24 - Visual Mastery & API Edition)

This is the definitive handbook for executing the `vc-diligence` skill. It combines **Recursive Hypothesis-Driven Discovery** with **Hyper-Depth Content Harvesting**, **Specialized Architecture Auditing**, **Product-Market Fit (PMF) Leveling**, and **Excalidraw Visual Mastery**. The goal is to produce an **intimate, 30+ page master audit** that identifies the technical plumbing, commercial moats, and legal red-flags of any startup.

## 0. PREREQUISITES & SETUP (CRITICAL)
Before executing this skill, ensure the following dependencies are installed to support diagram rendering:
1. **Python Playwright**: `pip install playwright`
2. **Browser Binaries**: `npx playwright install chromium`
3. **Internal Renderer**: This skill depends on the `excalidraw-diagram` skill's renderer located at `/Users/harrisonluo/.agents/skills/excalidraw-diagram/references/render_excalidraw.py`.
4. **Specialized Agents**: 
    - Use `architecture-auditor` for Phase 4 & 10.5 (Technical Teardown).
    - Use `excalidraw-diagram` for Phase 12 (Diagram Generation).

## 1. THE "HYPER-DEPTH" ANALYST MINDSET

### 1.1 The 30-Page Master Mandate
A brief summary is a failure. You are building an exhaustive legal and commercial case.
- **The Isomorphism Principle**: Diagrams must convey business logic through structure, not just labels. If you remove the text, the shape should still be the meaning.
- **The Education Test**: Could someone learn something concrete from the diagram? It must show actual formats, real event names, and concrete examples.
- **The Traceability Rule**: Every claim MUST be backed by a link or raw finding file.
- **Fact-Dense Writing**: Omit fluff. Use metrics, specific library names, and exact pricing.
- **Exhaustive Extraction**: Use `web_fetch` on 10-20 sources per wave. **Snippets are insufficient.** You MUST extract full text to construct detailed feature breakdowns.
- **The Search-to-Fetch Ratio**: For every Turn that includes a `google_web_search`, you MUST execute a corresponding `web_fetch` Turn for the top 3-5 high-signal results.

## 4. PHASE 1: OBJECTIVE-ORIENTED RECURSIVE SEARCH & CONTENT HARVESTING

### 4.1 The Wave-Based Discovery Objectives (Hyper-Depth)

**Wave 0: Product DNA & User Persona (The Foundation)**
- **Central Question**: "What exactly is the product, how does it function for the end-user, and who are the core personas it serves?"
- **Guiding Mandate**: Understand the 'Jobs to be Done' before auditing the 'Right to Win'.
- **Discovery Specifics**: Feature inventory, user personas (Economic Buyer vs. Daily User), UX/Workflow mapping, and core value prop.
- **Example Evidence**: A 'How it Works' page; a user manual; onboarding tutorials; detailed customer testimonials.

**Wave 0.5: Product-Market Fit (PMF) Audit**
- **Central Question**: "At what level of PMF is this startup currently operating (Level 1–4), and what are the signals of satisfaction, demand, and efficiency?"
- **The PMF Method (First Round Framework)**:
    - **Level 1 (Nascent)**: Solving a problem for 3-5 customers. Qualitative: "The Grind."
    - **Level 2 (Developing)**: Scalable sales channel emerging. Qualitative: "Lite PMF."
    - **Level 3 (Strong)**: Floodgates open. Efficiency + GTM refinement. Qualitative: "The Geyser."
    - **Level 4 (Extreme)**: Categorical dominance. Global expansion.
- **Discovery Specifics**: Retention/Usage depth (Satisfaction), Sales velocity/Inbound (Demand), Magic Number/Burn Multiple (Efficiency).

**Wave 1: Identity, Trajectory & Capital Structure**
- **Central Question**: "Who is this company at its core, how much capital have they consumed, and what is their growth velocity?"
- **Discovery Specifics**:
    - **Legal Structure**: Identify parent entity, DBAs, and former names.
    - **Cap Table Proxies**: Hunt for funding announcements and SEC Form D filings.
    - **Hiring Velocity**: Search for "LinkedIn Headcount Growth" patterns or historical job postings.
- **Example Evidence**: A Press Release confirming funding rounds; a Crunchbase entry showing round intervals.

**Wave 2: Founder Alpha & Talent Density**
- **Central Question**: "Why is this specific team uniquely qualified to win this category, and what are their individual 'superpowers'?"
- **Discovery Specifics**:
    - **The 'Spike'**: Identify the world-class expertise of each founder (Academic, Serial, BigTech).
    - **Social Graph**: Search for testimonials, board seats, or past managers.
    - **Conflict/Cohesion**: Find evidence of past collaboration (worked together at X for Y years).
- **Example Evidence**: Google Scholar profiles; LinkedIn recommendations; academic publication history.

**Wave 3: Technical Architecture & Product Moat**
- **Central Question**: "Exactly how is this built, where are the structural bottlenecks, and is it a defensible moat or a thin wrapper?"
- **MANDATORY**: Use `web_fetch` on all technical docs, API references, and engineering blogs found. Build a component-by-component feature teardown.
- **Discovery Specifics**:
    - **Infrastructure Stack**: Identify the 'Plumbing' (AWS/GCP, DBs, LLM providers).
    - **Proprietary IP**: Search for internal project names, custom protocols, or patents.
    - **Performance Benchmarks**: Hunt for latency, throughput, or accuracy metrics.
- **Example Evidence**: API references; GitHub dependency audits; technical whitepapers.

**Wave 4: Market Dynamics & Competitive Displacement**
- **Central Question**: "Which $B+ market is being eaten, who are the incumbents being displaced, and what are the exit benchmarks?"
- **The Synthesis Mandate**: Do NOT search for "TAM SAM SOM." Search for **Atomic Facts**:
    - **Market Size Proxies**: "Total number of [Target User Profile]" or "Total addressable market of [Industry Sector]".
    - **Pricing Proxies**: "[Competitor] pricing" or "[Incumbent] revenue per user".
    - **Adoption Proxies**: "[Competitor] customer count".
- **Hypothesis-First (MANDATORY)**: Based on Waves 1-3, define the *disrupted market* and name the *likely incumbents* and *emerging challengers*.
- **Discovery Specifics**:
    - **Incumbent Vulnerability**: Search for "Negative Reviews" or "Integrations Issues" with incumbents.
    - **Category Pricing**: Hunt for competitor pricing pages or 'Talk to Sales' leakages.
    - **Exit Comps**: Find 3-5 recent M&A deals in the sector.
- **Example Evidence**: A Forrester Wave report showing the incumbent's market share is declining; an M&A deal at a 12x revenue multiple.

### 4.2 Query Fanout Mandate
For every Central Question or Hypothesis, you MUST generate a **fanout of 3-5 distinct, multi-angle queries**.
- **Angle 1: Direct Discovery**: (e.g., `\"[Startup] [Topic]\"`)
- **Angle 2: Proxy Signals**: Search for indirect evidence (e.g., `\"[Topic] reviews\"`, `"hiring for [Topic]"`).
- **Angle 3: Technical/Source-Specific**: Target deep sources (`site:github.com`, `filetype:pdf`).
- **Angle 4: Competitive/Market Context**: (e.g., `\"[Startup] vs [Competitor]\"`).

### 4.3 The Search Critic & Intent SOP (Least-to-Most Protocol)
Before executing ANY query, apply **Least-to-Most Prompting**:
1. **Decomposition**: "Break the Central Question down into the fundamental sub-questions that need to be answered first."
2. **Sequential Solving**: "Solve each sub-question one by one, using the answer from the previous step to inform the next search angle."
3. **The 'Reasonable Searchability' Check**: Search for the **atomic ingredients** instead of the **finished meal**.
4. **The Search-to-Fetch Mandate**: For each query fanout, identify the top high-signal URLs and execute `web_fetch`.

---

## 5. PHASE 4: SPECIALIZED TECHNICAL TEARDOWN (ARCHITECTURE AUDITOR)

**CRITICAL DELEGATION**: For this phase, you MUST activate the `architecture-auditor` skill.

1.  **Harvest Ingredients**: Collect real API names, JSON schemas, and method calls to prove the depth of integration.
2.  **Audit Moat**: Use the `architecture-auditor` specialist to perform the "Wrapper vs. Moat" test.
3.  **Feature Teardown**: Draft the detailed component-by-component analysis for the final report.

---

## 6. PHASE 5: PRODUCT-MARKET FIT (PMF) AUDIT & LEVELING

You MUST apply the **First Round Capital PMF Method** to determine the company's trajectory.

### 6.1 The 3 Dimensions of PMF
1. **Satisfaction**: Audit customer reviews, developer forums (Discord/Reddit), and case studies. Are they "Friend-zoned" (like but don't need) or is it a "Painkiller"?
2. **Demand**: Search for inbound interest signals, waiting lists, and pricing power (ability to raise prices without churn).
3. **Efficiency**: Calculate/Model the Magic Number, Burn Multiple, and CAC Payback based on revenue vs. headcount growth.

### 6.2 The 4 Levers (The 4Ps) Evaluation
If the company is stuck between levels, identify which lever they are pulling:
- **Persona**: Moving upmarket or changing the ICP.
- **Problem**: Pivoting to a more urgent/important problem.
- **Promise**: Refining the unique value prop.
- **Product**: Feature iteration to meet the promise.

---

## 7. PHASE 10.5: FORMAL VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATION (FACT-DENSE)

Before creating Excalidraw diagrams, you MUST write a **Visual Design Specification** that formalizes the argument. Use the `architecture-auditor` skill to ensure the spec is technical and accurate.

### 7.1 The Research Mandate (Visual Ingredients)
For each diagram, you must list the **Evidence Artifacts** discovered in research:
- **Architecture**: List the actual API endpoints, event names, and model names.
- **Market**: List the specific market share percentages and incumbent names.
- **Economic**: List the exact ARR milestones and gross margin percentages.

---

## 8. PHASE 11: SYNTHESIS - THE MASTER DELIVERABLES PROTOCOL

### 8.1 `full_diligence_report.md` (The 30+ Page Master Audit)
- **Header 1: Executive Summary** (3-paragraph distillation).
- **Header 2: Company Profile & Core Product** (Legal names, pivots, exhaustive feature list with sub-bullets).
- **Header 3: Product-Market Fit Audit** (Satisfaction/Demand/Efficiency dimensions, PMF Level 1-4 verdict).
- **Header 4: The Founder Alpha Audit** (Complete histories, social graphs, citations, and links).
- **Header 5: Financing & Capital Structure** (Round-by-round partners, valuations, board composition).
- **Header 6: Detailed Technical Architecture** (Plumbing, stack choices, bottlenecks, "Wrapper vs. Moat" test).
- **Header 7: Market & Competitive Landscape** (TAM/SAM/SOM synthesis, incumbent weaknesses, displacement economics table).

- **Header 9: Legal, Regulatory & Governance** (IP provenance, compliance status).
- **Header 10: Master Research Appendix** (Categorized links and full source citations).
- **Header 11: Final Investment Verdict** (Detailed rationale explaining the "Why").

---

## 9. PHASE 11.5: THE ITERATIVE MASTER EXPANSION STEP (MANDATORY)

Once the initial draft of the `full_diligence_report.md` is complete, you MUST execute this iterative expansion cycle:
1. **Section Elaborator**: Add at least 3-5 verbose paragraphs per major section.
2. **Structural Depth**: Convert flat lists into hierarchical structures with H3/H4 sub-headings and nested sub-bullets.
3. **Citation Check**: Ensure every factual claim has a corresponding source link (3-5 links per section).

---

## 10. PHASE 12: ADVANCED VISUAL ARGUMENTATION (SKILL DELEGATION)

**CRITICAL MANDATE**: Do NOT attempt to generate Excalidraw JSON manually. Use the `activate_skill` tool to invoke the `excalidraw-diagram` skill.

1. **Invoke the Skill**: Pass your detailed `Visual Design Specification` to the `excalidraw-diagram` skill.
2. **Rendering**: After the skill generates the `.excalidraw` files, use the internal renderer to convert them to PNGs:
   - **Command**: `python3 ~/.agents/skills/excalidraw-diagram/references/render_excalidraw.py diligence_[startup]/diagrams/[filename].excalidraw`

---

## 11. PHASE 15: EXCALIDRAW TECHNICAL REFERENCE & JSON PROTOCOL

To ensure diagrams are high-quality and correctly rendered, follow these strict JSON schema rules.

### 11.1 The Two-Way Binding Rule (CRITICAL)
Every text element inside a container MUST be bound correctly to prevent empty boxes.
1.  **Container (Rectangle/Ellipse/Diamond)**: Must have a `boundElements` array containing the text element's ID.
2.  **Text Element**: Must have a `containerId` property pointing to the parent shape's ID.

### 11.2 Semantic Color Palette
Use colors to encode meaning from `references/color-palette.md`:
- **AI/LLM**: Fill `#ddd6fe`, Stroke `#6d28d9`
- **Start/Trigger**: Fill `#fed7aa`, Stroke `#c2410c`
- **Success/End**: Fill `#a7f3d0`, Stroke `#047857`
- **Decision**: Fill `#fef3c7`, Stroke `#b45309`
- **Primary/Neutral**: Fill `#3b82f6`, Stroke `#1e3a5f`

### 11.3 Element Template (JSON Example)
```json
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "id": "node-01",
      "type": "rectangle",
      "x": 100, "y": 100, "width": 250, "height": 100,
      "backgroundColor": "#ddd6fe",
      "strokeColor": "#6d28d9",
      "roundness": { "type": 3 },
      "boundElements": [{ "id": "text-01", "type": "text" }]
    },
    {
      "id": "text-01",
      "type": "text",
      "containerId": "node-01",
      "text": "L4: Deep Core Aggregator\n(600M+ Human Docs)",
      "textAlign": "center",
      "verticalAlign": "middle",
      "fontSize": 16,
      "fontFamily": 3,
      "x": 110, "y": 125, "width": 230, "height": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

### 11.4 Visual Patterns for Arguments
- **Spiral/Cycle**: For feedback loops (e.g., telemetry refining models).
- **Assembly Line**: For data transformation pipelines.
- **Fan-Out**: For single triggers spawning multiple effects.
- **Convergence**: For multiple signals synthesized into a verdict.

---

## 12. FINAL QUALITY ASSURANCE & HAND-OFF

### 19.1 Hand-off
"Diligence complete. Overview Memo, Deep Dive, and 30+ page Master Audit (with full feature teardowns, iteratively expanded details, and specialized visual diagrams) are in `deliverables/`."
